Welcome to the main repository of **OMGG** — our independent studio specialising in **digitising board games**.  
Our ambition: create gaming experiences that are accessible anywhere, anytime, while respecting the essence of the original game.

## About us

OMGG is an initiative that originated as part of our study project at [Epitech](https://www.epitech.eu/), with the aim of supporting board game publishers in their digital transformation through three major areas:

### 1️⃣ Digitisation

🎮 *Transforming physical games into interactive digital experiences*
We adapt the mechanics, visuals and rules of a physical game to create a version that can be played on PC, console and/or mobile.

### 2️⃣ Design

📱 *Creating intelligent companion apps to enrich the player experience*
Examples:
- Automated scoring system
- Turn or secret role manager
- Notifications of specific effects or rules
These tools are designed to streamline gameplay, avoid counting or rule errors, and modernise the experience without distorting the game.

### 3️⃣ Prototyping

🧪 *Quickly test and refine game concepts using digital versions*
Our solutions allow you to simulate a game in development in order to validate its mechanics before printing or production.
